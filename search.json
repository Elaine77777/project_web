    "text": "This study is about sentimental levels and pronouns of texts in relation to genre. Genres with dissimilar explicit or implicit requirements can result in different word choices, uses of pronouns, depending on the specific requisites on objectivity of the genre. Formal writing genres, like essays, often expect authors to write in scientific manners, employing less sentimental words, more objective words, and third-person pronouns, whereas fictions or personal letters have contradicting expectations for their authors. In this way, through text analysis and sentiment analysis and comparing and contrasting sentimental levels and pronounces used in different genres and results of analysis from each genre, the study can hypothetically predict of the genre of the text, based on sentimental and pronounces the text contained.\n\n\nThis section summarizes previous research related to the topic and identifies gaps that the current study aims to address. It is important to provide a comprehensive review of the literature to demonstrate the significance of the research question and the potential contributions of the study. The literature review should conclude with a clear statement of the research question or hypothesis that the study aims to address.",

    "text": "Data preparation & Analysis\nPhase 1: Harvest social media data and compile a corpus\nIn this stage, automated tools can be used to query records of social media data, extract this data, and compile it into a corpus (citation记得写). Ideally, API of AO3 can be used to extract data from it, and the collected data will incorporate into a larger database like COCA, which contains writings in other genres. The collected data will first be categorized based on their genre, such as fiction, novel, or letter, etc.\nPhase 2: Categorize and subset variables\nAll the sentimental words will be extracted from the text and classified into the basic categories, using the method of sentimental analysis. The average level of sentiments in each genre will be calculated. Each level of sentiments will be assigned a distinct value (E.g. Super positive/negative-1, positive/negative-0.5, neutral-0).\nThen, similar methods will be employed to find relation between the use of pronounce and genre. All the pronouns used in text will also be extracted from the text and classified them to be first, second, or third-pronoun. The percentage of each type of pronouns used in each text will be calculated, then the average percentage of each type of pronouns used in each genre can also be calculated. The preferences in the use of pronouns in each genre can then be indicated.\nPhase 3: Analyze and visualize\nFirst, using sum of all the values in each text to divide the total number of sentimental words will be the average strong level of sentimental words in the text, and using this value, the average strong level of sentimental words in each genre will then be found. Tables representing sentimental level of text in relation of genre can then be drawn. Similarly, tables that visualize relation between genre and preference in the use of pronouns, or pronoun preference and strong level of sentimental words in each genre will be displayed, which will either prove or falsify the hypothesis.",
