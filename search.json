It classified sentimental expressions into five basic categories: super positive, positive, super negative, negative and neutral, drawing general conclusions on individuals’ sentiments and their sentimental level in diverse posts. The same method can be employed to analyze other genres of writings, exploring sentimental levels and tendency in dissimilar genres. This study aims to find correlation among the use of pronounces and sentimental words and genres. Through employing methods of text analysis and sentiment analysis and comparing and contrasting uses of sentimental words and pronounces in different genres and results of analysis from each genre, the study is able to predictition of the genre of the text, based on sentimental words and pronounces the text contained.",

    "text": "This study is about sentimental levels and pronouns of texts in relation to genre. Genres with dissimilar explicit or implicit requirements can result in different word choices, uses of pronouns, depending on the specific requisites on objectivity of the genre. Formal writing genres, like essays, often expect authors to write in scientific manners, employing less sentimental words, more objective words, and third-person pronouns, whereas fictions or personal letters have contradicting expectations for their authors. In this way, through text analysis and sentiment analysis and comparing and contrasting sentimental levels and pronounces used in different genres and results of analysis from each genre, the study can hypothetically predict of the genre of the text, based on sentimental and pronounces the text contained.\n\n\nBalahur presents a method for sentiment analysis using Twitter data (tweets) as an example, taking into account their structure, length and specific language. The approach employed makes it easily extendible to other languages and makes it able to process tweets in near real time. The main contri- butions of this work are: a) the pre-processing of tweets to normalize the language and gener- alize the vocabulary employed to express sentiment; b) the use minimal linguistic process- ing, which makes the approach easily portable to other languages; c) the inclusion of higher order n-grams to spot modifications in the po- larity of the sentiment expressed; d) the use of simple heuristics to select features to be em- ployed; e) the application of supervised learn- ing using a simple Support Vector Machines linear classifier on a set of realistic data. Similar methods can be applied in analyzing data collected for this research A (2013).\nThe paper “OPINION EVENTS: TYPES AND OPINION MARKERS IN ENGLISH SOCIAL MEDIA DISCOURSE” by Barbara Lewandowska-Tomaszczyk investigates opinion events and opinion markers in English social media discourse. It explores various types of opinion events and identifies the linguistic markers used to express opinions in online discussions. The study employs a corpus-based approach to analyze social media data and identifies patterns in how opinions are expressed and shared on platforms like Twitter or Facebook. The paper provides insights into the structure and characteristics of opinion events in online discourse, shedding light on the role of language in shaping and disseminating opinions in the digital age Lewandowska-Tomaszczyk et al. (2023).\nAndreotta presents a mixed-methods approach for analyzing social media data that integrates computational and qualitative text analysis techniques. The framework proposed in the paper combines quantitative methods such as machine learning and natural language processing with qualitative methods like thematic analysis and discourse analysis. This comprehensive approach enables researchers to gain deeper insights into social media data by combining the strengths of both computational and qualitative approaches. The paper discusses the rationale behind using mixed methods, outlines the steps involved in the framework, and provides examples of how it can be applied in social media research. Overall, the paper contributes to the methodological toolkit for studying social media phenomena by offering a systematic and flexible approach that leverages the complementary strengths of computational and qualitative analysis methods Andreotta et al. (2019).\nDespot discusses the current automatic detection mechanism of offensive language and its shortcomings and how current situation can be improved. This study argues that current difficulties in detecting implicit offence are exacerbated by multiple factors: (a) inadequate definitions of implicit and explicit offense; (b) an insufficient typology of implicit offence; and (c) a dearth of detailed analysis of implicitly offensive linguistic data. In this study, based on a qualitative analysis of an implicitly offensive dataset, a new typology of implicitly offensive language is proposed along with a detailed, example-led account of the new typology, an operational definition of implicitly offensive language, and a thorough analysis of the role of figurative language and humour in each type. Our analyses identify three main issues with previous datasets and typologies used in NLP approaches: (a) conflating content and form in the annotation; (b) treating figurativeness, particularly metaphor, as the main device of implicitness, while ignoring its equally important role in the explicit offence; and (c) an over-focus on form-specific datasets (e.g. focusing only on offensive comparisons), which fails to reflect the full complexity of offensive language use. This article could be referential being applied to the filed of sentimental analysis, since sentiments are also subtle, contextual, and plausibly deniable. Through combining context and machine learning, computational analysis and detection mechanism may be more accurate inthe future Despot, Anić, and Veale (2023).",
