  Social media platforms, depending on their targeted users and fucntions, now have develop various genres for different types of posts, such as instagram posts, discussion posts on Quora, or short fictions fans posted to share and interact with each other in AO3. Some genres are similar to traditional writing genres, while some others do not. To maintain consistency in text analysis, online fictions, including fan fictions, will be employed to compare and contrast with traditional novels, fictions, and academic writing. This study aims to conduct a sentiment analysis across platforms, to compare and contrast the dominant sentiment in different platforms, and potentiall to analyze the reason behind the phenomenon.

# Introduction

This study is about sentiment levels of expressions in relation to platforms, whether the posted expressions are mainly super positive, positive, negative, or super negative. Internet has become an indispensable part of people's life today, and different social media has different potential users. Twitter and Facebook often include a large spectrum of users, from seniors to teens, meanwhile, Instagram posts often are often targeted young audiences, etc. Yet, would different targeted users and potential audiences influence the sentiment level of the posts users post online? This is also what this project aims to find out.

<!--
So the idea is to try to see if there are generational patterns in the use of sentiment in online venues? This is an interesting question, and I think you will find some interesting results. Do you have some reasoning for what you expect to find? What does the literature say about this?

## Literature review

@balahur-2013-sentiment presents a method for sentiment analysis using Twitter data (tweets) as an example, taking into account their structure, length and specific language. The approach employed makes it easily extendible to other languages and makes it able to process tweets in near real time. The main contributions of this work are: (a) the pre-processing of tweets to normalize the language and generalize the vocabulary employed to express sentiment; (b) the use minimal linguistic processing, which makes the approach easily portable to other languages; (c) the inclusion of higher order n-grams to spot modifications in the polarity of the sentiment expressed; (d) the use of simple heuristics to select features to be employed; (e) the application of supervised learning using a simple Support Vector Machines linear classifier on a set of realistic data. Similar methods can be applied in analyzing data collected for this research.

<!-- OK. This is a methods article, cool. -->

The paper "OPINION EVENTS: TYPES AND OPINION MARKERS IN ENGLISH SOCIAL MEDIA DISCOURSE" by @LewandowskaTomaszczyk2023 investigates opinion events and opinion markers in English social media discourse. It explores various types of opinion events and identifies the linguistic markers used to express opinions in online discussions. The study employs a corpus-based approach to analyze social media data and identifies patterns in how opinions are expressed and shared on platforms like Twitter or Facebook. The paper provides insights into the structure and characteristics of opinion events in online discourse, shedding light on the role of language in shaping and disseminating opinions in the digital age.

<!-- OK. Good, this gives some context for the looking at opinion in social media. I wonder if the generational differences you may look at might be conditioned by the topics that are addressed. What do you think?  -->

@Andreotta2019 presents a mixed-methods approach for analyzing social media data that integrates computational and qualitative text analysis techniques. The framework proposed in the paper combines quantitative methods such as machine learning and natural language processing with qualitative methods like thematic analysis and discourse analysis. This comprehensive approach enables researchers to gain deeper insights into social media data by combining the strengths of both computational and qualitative approaches. The paper discusses the rationale behind using mixed methods, outlines the steps involved in the framework, and provides examples of how it can be applied in social media research. Overall, the paper contributes to the methodological toolkit for studying social media phenomena by offering a systematic and flexible approach that leverages the complementary strengths of computational and qualitative analysis methods.

<!-- OK. Another, different nuance, on methods for social media analysis -->

@Despot2023 discusses the current automatic detection mechanism of offensive language and its shortcomings and how current situation can be improved. This study argues that current difficulties in detecting implicit offence are exacerbated by multiple factors: (a) inadequate definitions of implicit and explicit offense; (b) an insufficient typology of implicit offence; and (c) a dearth of detailed analysis of implicitly offensive linguistic data. In this study, based on a qualitative analysis of an implicitly offensive dataset, a new typology of implicitly offensive language is proposed along with a detailed, example-led account of the new typology, an operational definition of implicitly offensive language, and a thorough analysis of the role of figurative language and humour in each type. Their analyses identify three main issues with previous datasets and typologies used in NLP approaches: (a) conflating content and form in the annotation; (b) treating figurativeness, particularly metaphor, as the main device of implicitness, while ignoring its equally important role in the explicit offence; and (c) an over-focus on form-specific datasets (e.g. focusing only on offensive comparisons), which fails to reflect the full complexity of offensive language use. This article could be referential being applied to the filed of sentiment analysis, since sentiments are also subtle, contextual, and plausibly deniable. Through combining context and machine learning, computational analysis and detection mechanism may be more accurate inthe future @Despot2023.

It will be very helpful to frame your research to include references that approach the topic of sentiment analysis in social media. This will help you to better understand the context of your research question and how it is similar and different from other research in the field.

Then you will also have a better handle on what methods will be most appropriate for your research question.

# Methods

Recalling that the aim of this study is to explore sentiment levels and pronouns of texts in relation to genre, units of observation here will be writings in various genres, and variables needed to explore will be: **sentiment words**, **sentiment level of the word** (Very positive/negative, positive/negative, or neutral), **number of sentiment words contained**, **pronouns** (first, second, or third), **number of pronouns words contained**, and **genre of the text** (fan fiction, novel, letters, email, academic writing, etc.).

<!-- I'm a bit confused, from what you've written above, it seemed as if you had changed your focus to be social media alone. Is that not the case?

Please clarify this methods section to reflect the focus of your research and also include a bit more about what type of research this is: exploratory, predictive, or inference. From what I can gather, it seems as if you are working in the exploratory/ predictive area. But you need to reflect whatever research aim you are going to emply. -->

First, data will be pulled from social media and other types of textual corpora database. Then, the pulled texts will first be processed and needed variables will be extracted from the collected texts. Thirdly, subsets of data will be analyzed respectively to examine whether or not its results fit the hypothesis. Lastly, all the data and their correlation will be visualized.


# Data preparation & Analysis

**Phase 1: Harvest social media data and compile a corpus**

In this stage, automated tools can be used to query records of social media data, extract this data, and compile it into a corpus @Andreotta2019. Ideally, data from Twitter and Instagram will be collected: [Twitter-API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) and [Facebook/Instagram](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api). Also ideally, similar amount of data from roughly the same time interval should be collected from each platform.

**Phase 2: Categorize and subset variables**

<!-- OK. I see that you mention 'topic modeling'. We didn't cover this in detail in this course but it could be useful --however social media posts are short and topic modeling requires more text per observation to work well. -->

An idealized structure for the topic modeling dataset is seen in @tbl-topic-ideal:

| variable | name | type | description |
|----------|------|-------------|--|
| post_id | Post ID | integer | Unique identifier for each post |
| post_year | Post Year | integer | Year of the Post |
| type | Word type | character | Individual words from the `text` variable |
| frequency | Frequency | integer | Frequency of the word type in the `text` variable |

: Idealized structure for the topic modeling dataset {#tbl-topic-ideal tbl-colwidths="[15, 15, 15, 55]"}

<!-- The subsequent description aligns with a sentiment analysis, but not a topic modeling analysis. Let me know if you need some clarification on the distinct goals of each type of analysis. -->

First, all the extracted data will be given a unique identifier and the date, the year, the post is published will also be recorded. Then, using the method of sentiment analysis, we tokenize all the text and filter all the variables that are necessary need for this project to reduce some complexity. With the `frequency`, content words with highest frequency may also be observed in this project.

Then, introducing the `bing` lexicon, all the sentiment words will be extracted from the text and classified into the basic categories, using the method of sentiment analysis. The average level of sentiments in each platform will be calculated. Each level of sentiments will be assigned a distinct value (*E.g. Super positive/negative-1, positive/negative-0.5, neutral-0*). Now introducing the `left_join()` function, it will be "attach" the `sentiment` column to the original dataset.

**Phase 3: Analyze and visualize**

First, using sum of all the values in each text to divide the total number of sentiment words will be the average strong level of sentiment words in the text, and using this value, the average strong level of words in each platform and words with highest frequency will then be found. Tables representing sentiment level of text in relation of genre can then be drawn.
Similarly, tables that visualize relation between platform and preference in the use of content words. The strong level of sentiment words in each platform will be displayed, which will either prove or falsify the hypothesis.

<!-- Again, the methods you are describing (topic modeling and sentiment analysis) are not tools for inference. They are exploratory methods. As such, there will not be a hypothesis, rather a research question. This is an important distinction. -->

# Expected results

Formal academic writing is more likely to use third-person pronouns and neutral level of sentiment words, compared to fan fiction/ If the the text employ more first/second pronouns with the use of strong level of sentiment words, it is likely to be fiction.

<!--
These details on the expected results are not aligned with the above introduction, methods, and data preparation. Again, if they are important for this analysis, then you need to make that case in the introduction and methods. This should be supported by literature or some other rationale.

-->


# Communication plan

The intended audience for the study can be anyone who is interested in linguistics, or anyone who wants to explore how genre may influence writers' word choices in the use of pronouns and sentiment words. The results of the study will be presented orally and visually in class, and the html version of the study will be open-source for the public, which audiences may find in github.

<!-- Again, good to see you are thinking about this. -->
